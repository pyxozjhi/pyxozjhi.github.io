I'm an *IT professional* living in *San Francisco*. For the most part, this blog will center around my beginnings in cybersecurity, with a focus in reversing and packet analysis.

My fascination for hacker culture came at a young age when words like _phreak_, _cracker_, and _leet_ were still relevant to the underground colloquial. It's hard to believe that in only a decade, _hacking_, a term once abused by media to describe the delinquent activities of cyberpunks, had matured into the socially integrated practice we know it as today. Then again, I couldn't imagine computing without its natural counterpart...the breakers. I mean that besides its rise into academia and mainstream cinema, hacking is now a fundamental tool for survival. Cybercrime, cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism...it was indeed by necessity that I'd found my purpose in cybersecurity.

Not a fan of social media, but some of my study material is public. For those who'd be interested, I'll make it available for you to peruse.
