I'm an *IT professional* living in *San Francisco*. For the time being, this blog will center around my newfound ventures in reversing and packet analysis.

My fascination for hacking came at a young age when "2600", "Warez" and "Sub7" were still relevant buzzwords in the computing underground. To no surprise, what once was believed to be a disagreeable practice carried out by cyberpunks, would eventually find its acceptance by our culture as an academic and socially integrated study. And as this space further evolved into a rich and complex admixture of disciplines, it became imperative to me to finally get involved. Albeit late, once my purpose came to fruition, I started my intimated quest into what we know today as _cybersecurity_.

### Nota bene

My study material is primarily security-related. For those who might be interested, I made some feeds available for you to peruse.
