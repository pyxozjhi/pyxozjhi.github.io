I'm an *IT professional* living in *San Francisco*. For the time being, this blog will center around my newfound ventures in reversing and packet analysis.

My fascination for hacking came at a young age when "2600", "Warez" and "Sub7" were still relevant buzzwords in the computing underground. To no surprise, what once was believed to be a disagreeable practice carried out by cyberpunks would eventually find its acceptance by our culture, not only as a necessity, but also as an academic and socially integrated study. And as this space further evolves into a rich and complex admixture of disciplines, it became more an imperative for me to get involved. Once my purpose came to fruition, I embarked upon a journey to finally pursue what we know today as _cybersecurity_.

### Nota bene

My study material is primarily security-related. For those who'd be interested, I made some of those feeds available for you to peruse.
